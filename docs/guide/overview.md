## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Stealth SDK is built around a core package that connects the framework and adapters together. This modular design allows developers to easily extend and customize the SDK to meet their specific needs. This core package will run as the backend, keeping track of conversations, context, and handling all interactions with the AI models. This backend allows for any framework or adapter to be slotted in, enabling seamless integration with a multitude of platforms and languages.

The clients, on the other hand, are responsible for handling the user interface and user interactions. They will communicate with the backend to send and receive messages, and display the AI responses to the user. The clients can be built using any technology or platform, as long as they can communicate with the backend.
