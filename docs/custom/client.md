# Custom Client

## üìù Overview

A client is an integration with a language or platform that interacts with the Stealth SDK backend. Clients should be able to keep track of users, conversations and characters and be able to display messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating a Client

There is no standardized way to create a client - it should be created based on the language or platform that it is being integrated with. However, the client should be able to interact with the Stealth SDK backend. The available endpoints are documented below, along with expected responses. You may also access an API reference when running a backend by appending `/reference` to the URL.
